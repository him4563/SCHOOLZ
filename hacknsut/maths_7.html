        Introduction

Lines, angles and rays are the basic concept of geometrical figures. Basic geometrical figure was first introduced in text by great mathematician Euclid. <br>

 

<br><b>Lines and Its Characteristics</b> <br><br>

<b>Point</b> <br>

A precise location or place on a plane. Point is usually represented by dot. <br><br>
<b>Line</b> <br>

Line is a geometrical figure formed by points moving along a fixed direction and the reverse direction. Line may be straight or curved. <br><br>
<b>Line Segment</b> <br>

A straight line which links two points without extending beyond them. <br><br>
<b>Ray</b> <br>

A ray extends infinity in one direction, but ends at a single point in the other direction. <br>
<b>Intersecting Point</b> <br><br>

The point where two lines meet or cross. <br>
In the pictures above points J, K, L, M and O are intersecting points.

 

<br> To Draw a Line Segment of a given Length <br>

The following are the steps used to draw the line segment. <br>

For example: Line segment of 6 cm. <br>

Step 1: Place the ruler on the plane paper. <br>

Step 2: Mark a point A on the paper against 0 mark of ruler. <br>

Step 3: Mark another point B on the same paper at the length of 6 cm. <br>

Step 4: Draw a line between A and B.

    <b>Addition and Subtraction</b> <br>

Addition and subtraction are the two primary arithmetic operations where we learn to add and subtract two or more numbers or any mathematical values. The other two basic math operations are multiplication and division. The symbol to represent addition is ‘+’ (plus sign) and subtraction is ‘-’ (minus sign). <br>

Both addition and subtraction are inverse operations of each other. For example, if 9 + 1 = 10, then 10 – 1 = 9. That shows if 1 is added to 9 then the result is 10, whereas if 1 is subtracted from 10, then the result is 9. <br>
